# Diffity Resolve Skill

You are reading open review comments and resolving them by making the requested code changes.

## Arguments

- `thread-id` (optional): Resolve a specific thread by ID instead of all open threads. Example: `/diffity-resolve abc123`

## CLI Reference

```
diffity agent diff
diffity agent list [--status open|resolved|dismissed] [--json]
diffity agent comment --file <path> --line <n> [--end-line <n>] [--side new|old] --body "<text>"
diffity agent general-comment --body "<text>"
diffity agent resolve <id> [--summary "<text>"]
diffity agent dismiss <id> [--reason "<text>"]
diffity agent reply <id> --body "<text>"
```

- `--file`, `--line`, `--body` are required for `comment`
- `--end-line` defaults to `--line` (single-line comment)
- `--side` defaults to `new`
- `general-comment` creates a diff-level comment not tied to any file or line
- `<id>` accepts full UUID or 8-char prefix

## Prerequisites

1. Check that `diffity` is available: run `which diffity`. If not found, install it with `npm install -g diffity`.
2. Check that a review session exists: run `diffity agent list`. If this fails with "No active review session", tell the user to start diffity first (e.g. `diffity` or **/diffity-diff**).

## Instructions

1. List open comment threads with full details:
   ```
   diffity agent list --status open --json
   ```
   If a `thread-id` argument was provided, filter to just that thread. The JSON output includes the full comment body, file path, line numbers, and side for each thread.
2. If there are no open threads, tell the user there's nothing to resolve.
3. For each open thread, check the `comments` array and the `author.type` field (`"user"` or `"agent"`) on each comment:
   a. **Skip** general comments (filePath `__general__`) — these are summaries, not actionable code changes.
   b. **Skip** threads where the last comment is an agent reply that asks the user a question (e.g. "Could you clarify...?") and the user hasn't responded yet — the agent is waiting for user input. Still process threads where the agent left the original comment (code suggestion, review feedback, etc.) — those are actionable.
   c. **`[nit]` comments** — these are minor suggestions but still actionable. Resolve them like any other comment.
   d. **`[question]` comments** (from the user) — read the question, examine the relevant code, and resolve the thread with your answer as the summary:
      ```
      diffity agent resolve <thread-id> --summary "Your answer here"
      ```
   e. Comments phrased as questions without an explicit `[question]` tag (e.g. "should we add X?" or "can we rename this?") are suggestions — treat them as actionable requests and make the change.
   f. Read the comment body from the JSON output and understand what change is requested. Interpret the intent:
      - If the comment suggests a code change, make the change.
      - If the comment suggests adding documentation, add or update the relevant docs.
      - If the comment asks a question that implies an action (e.g. "should we add X?"), treat it as a request to do that action.
      - If the comment is genuinely unclear and you cannot determine what action to take, reply asking for clarification instead of silently skipping:
        ```
        diffity agent reply <thread-id> --body "Could you clarify what change you'd like here?"
        ```
   g. Read the relevant source file to understand the full context around the commented lines, then make the requested change using the Edit tool.
   h. After making the change, resolve the thread with a summary:
      ```
      diffity agent resolve <thread-id> --summary "Fixed: <brief description of what was changed>"
      ```
4. After resolving all applicable threads, run `diffity agent list` to confirm status.
5. Tell the user to check the browser — resolved status will appear within 2 seconds via polling.
